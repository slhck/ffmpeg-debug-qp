# Requirements

You need Python 3 and the `ffmpeg_debug_qp` binary, which you have to build yourself.

For Windows, you can use the pre-built binary for the master branch, which can be found here: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/slhck/ffmpeg-debug-qp/artifacts/build.zip). Also download the DLL files from `build/dll.zip` and unzip them.

## UNIX platform

For building:

- libavdevice, libavformat, libavfilter, libavcodec, libswresample, libswscale, libavutil
- C compiler

For example on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt update && apt install libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavfilter-dev libavcodec-dev libswresample-dev libswscale-dev libavutil-dev build-essential pkg-config

## Windows platform

For building:

- Visual Studio >= 2015 with C/C++ compiler installed with 64 bit support
- Depending libraries (FFmpeg) are provided along the project, therefore no extra libraries are needed.

# Supported scenarios

Supported input:

- MPEG-2
- MPEG-4 Part 2
- H.264 / MPEG-4 Part 10 (AVC)

Supported formats:

- MPEG-4 Part 14
- H.264 Annex B bytestreams

# Building

## UNIX platform

Run the command `make`.

## Windows platform

- Open the solution file "ffmpeg-debug-qp.sln" which can be found in `build\ffmpeg-debug-qp\`
- Make sure to compile in release mode (See the dropdown on the top menu bar. This is not necessary per-se, but beneficial for speed at runtime)
- Build the tool ctrl+shift+B
- The binary will be available in `build\bin\`, required DLL files can be found in the 7zip archive which can be found in `build\bin.7z`
- Copy DLL and binary to the root of the folder `ffmpeg-debug-qp` so depending scripts such as `parse-qp-output.py` can find the binary.

# Usage

The main tool is a python library that first calls to ffmpeg-debug-qp and then parses and outputs the results.

You can run the library directly via `python3 -m ffmpeg_debug_qp_parser`, or install it with `pip`:

```
pip3 install --user ffmpeg_debug_qp_parser
```

The tool options are as follows:

```
usage: __main__.py [-h] [-f] [-of OUTPUT_FORMAT] [-p PATH_TO_TOOL] [-l | -k]
                   [-m | -a]
                   video|logfile output

Parse QP values from ffmpeg-debug-qp

positional arguments:
  video|logfile         Video file to generate output for, or existing logfile
  output                Output file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f, --force           Overwrite output
  -of OUTPUT_FORMAT, --output-format OUTPUT_FORMAT
                        Output format, one of: ld-json (default), json or csv
  -p PATH_TO_TOOL, --path-to-tool PATH_TO_TOOL
                        Path to ffmpeg-debug-qp (defaults to /usr/local/bin/)
  -l, --use-logfile     Use precalculated logfile instead of the video
  -k, --keep-logfile    Don't remove the temporary logfile 'video.debug'
  -m, --include-macroblock-data
                        Include macroblock-level data, such as: type,
                        interlaced and segmentation
  -a, --compute-averages-only
                        Only compute the frame-average QPs
```


## Example

To run a basic example:

    ffmpeg_debug_qp_parser input.mp4 output_file.json -m -of json

This reads the file `input.mp4` and produces a JSON file `output_file.json`, with a list of frames and each of their macroblocks in the format:

```
  [
      {
          "frameType": "I",
          "frameSize": 7787,
          "qpAvg": 26.87280701754386,
          "qpValues": [
              {
                  "qp": 25,
                  "type": "i",
                  "segmentation": "",
                  "interlaced": ""
              },
              {
                  "qp": 26,
                  "type": "i",
                  "segmentation": "",
                  "interlaced": ""
              }, ...
```

The frame and macroblock types are as per ffmpeg debug information. Same goes for segmentation and interlaced values.

For example outputs, see:

* Line-delimited JSON
  * [Averages only](examples/example-avgs.ldjson)
  * [Macroblock data](examples/example-mbdata.ldjson)
* JSON
  * [Averages only](examples/example-avgs.json)
  * [Macroblock data](examples/example-mbdata.json)
* CSV
  * [Averages only](examples/example-avgs.csv)
  * [Macroblock data](examples/example-mbdata.csv)
